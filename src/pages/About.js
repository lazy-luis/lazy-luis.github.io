      <p>
        Hi there, my name is Divine. And I'm a full-stack web developer. I've
        been in the development space for about 6 years now, started with
        desktop development with Java and visual basic, got a bit used to it,
        and after a year, I decided to try something new as the time, which was
        when I ventured into web development, where I have spent most of 5 years
        in, Just completed my education, in the University Of Ilorin, with a
        bachelor's degree in computer science, I'm proficient with HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, and PHP. Frameworks which I have worked within the times
        past, in JavaScript, I've worked with Vue Js and Onsen UI, while in PHP,
        I've worked with Laravel, CakePHP and slim PHP. When not coding, I like
        to spend a lot of my time, reading or playing games, I'm also a gaming
        fanatic, which is to say, was one of my inspirations when entering the
        development space.
